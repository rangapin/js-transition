            <p>"You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore,<br>
                where the sky is only a memory, and you float there, in the silence. <br>
                And you stay there, and you decide, that you'll die for them. <br>
                Only then do they start coming out. <br>
                They come, and they greet you, and they judge the love you have for them.<br>
                If it's sincere, if it's pure, they'll be with you, and take you away forever.!"
